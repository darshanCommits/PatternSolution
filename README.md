# Pattern Solutions Repository

Welcome to the Pattern Solutions repository, a collection of my solutions to various programming challenges and patterns. In this repository, you'll find well-structured and documented solutions to a wide range of problems, along with scripts that facilitate the compilation and execution of C files.

## Features

- **Diverse Set of Problems:** This repository contains solutions for a wide variety of programming problems, ranging from algorithmic challenges to design patterns.
[Link to Questions](./questions/QUESTIONS.md)

- **Organized Structure:** Each problem solution is organized within its own file, making it easy to navigate and understand.

- **No function used** This was made in my early days of learning C as College assignment, thus no function is used.

- **Language** Written in C. Logic is easily transferable to other languages.

- **Compilation and Execution Scripts:** To simplify the process of running C programs, I have provided two Bash scripts, "crun" and "run."

## Using "crun" and "run" Scripts

To streamline the process of compiling and running C programs, we've included two handy Bash scripts: "crun" and "run."

- **"crun" Script:** This script is designed for compiling and running individual C files. You can use it as follows:

    ```bash
    crun <your_source_file.c>
    ```

    - Use the `-H` flag to hide errors during execution, making it useful for debugging or quick testing.

- **"run" Script:** This script is useful for running all C files in a directory using "crun." It automates the execution process, making it easy to test multiple solutions at once:

    ```bash
    run
    ```

    - Use the `-H` flag with "run" to hide errors during execution.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute your own solutions or improvements to existing ones, please feel free to submit a pull request. We welcome your ideas and enhancements to make this repository even more valuable to the programming community.

Happy coding!
